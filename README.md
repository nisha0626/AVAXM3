# Custom Token Smart Contract Project
This project involves creating a custom token smart contract using Solidity, deploying it using the Hardhat development environment, and interacting with the contract via Remix. This README provides step-by-step instructions on setting up and using the project.

# Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed (for Hardhat)
Web browser with Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/) for contract interaction

# Smart Contract
contract NISHA_TOKEN 
contract NISHA_TOKEN is the main smart contract defining our token. 
You can modify this contract to customize the token's features, such as the name, symbol, total supply, and any additional functionality.

# Interacting with the Contract
Open Remix in your web browser: https://remix.ethereum.org/

In Remix, create a new file and paste the contents of contracts/CustomToken.sol.

Compile the contract by clicking the "Solidity Compiler" plugin and selecting your desired compiler version.

Deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy & Run Transactions" plugin. Select the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM, Injected Web3, etc.), and deploy the contract using the compiled bytecode.

Interact with the deployed contract using Remix's "Deployed Contracts" plugin. You can call functions, view contract state, and more.
